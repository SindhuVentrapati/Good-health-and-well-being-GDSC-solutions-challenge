            <p>Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that can occur after an insect sting or after eating certain
                foods. The adverse reaction can be very fast, occurring within seconds or minutes of coming into contact
                with the substance the person is allergic to.</p><br>
            <h2>Action:</h2>
            <p>Some people who know they have severe allergies may carry an adrenaline self-injector, which is a type of
                pre-loaded syringe. You can either help the person administer their medication or, if you're trained to
                do so, give it to them yourself.
                After the injection, continue to look after the person until medical help arrives.
